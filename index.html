      "My name is Taylor Sahm Zettel. I was born in Los Angeles, California, but I grew up in Elkridge, Maryland. My hobbies include reading, writing music, and working. 
      Oh, did I say working? I guess I do so much of it that it might as well be a hobby, seeing as I never get the chance to enjoy any of my actual hobbies anymore. 
      In the future, I would like to own a candy factory staffed by fashion models."
